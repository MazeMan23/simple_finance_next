Documents are accessible via any device with internet access, meaning it's not only possible, but very easy to provide a truly mobile workforce.",
        "ba2": "Simplified monthly budgeting: With Microsoft Office 365 you pay for what you want, for as long as you want. You can mix and match different types of licenses, providing email-only access for contractors, a full office suite for employees, and adding things like audio conferencing and mobile device management for more mobile staff. One license allows you to work on all your devices, or you can access web-based versions of each product.",
        "ba3": "Simplified access: Because all commonly used apps and document repositories are accessible with your Microsoft Office 365 account, it's easy to access the data you need from any device with internet access with a single user password. No more VPNs to connect to your shared data.",

        "ba5": "Secure protection: With all this data in the cloud and the ability to access it from multiple devices, security has never been more important.

        "ba6": "With Microsoft Office 365, you'll always have access to the latest product version, so you'll no longer have upgrade projects or team members with different versions of Office installed. Cloud storage with easy and secure ways to share Whether it's storing personal files using OneDrive (a more corporate version of DropBox) or organization-wide storage using SharePoint, it's now easy to store documents in the cloud. The documents you rely on can be synced offline so you can work with them even when you're not connected to the internet, and these tools also give you the ability to decide who to share documents or folders with internally or externally. Because it's all cloud-based, resilience and flexibility is built in, with a built-in option to restore previous versions or recover lost documents. Built-in continuity Because all data and applications are cloud-based, using highly resilient data centres replicated across multiple locations, you are no longer tied to your office location. Easy compliance In Microsoft Office 365, all data is stored in the organization's account, and access to it can be controlled centrally. Gains much more control and better data management.",
